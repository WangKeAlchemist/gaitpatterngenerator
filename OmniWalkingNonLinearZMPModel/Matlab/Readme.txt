It is a matlab code for a "ZMP-Based biped walking gate pattern generator"  by using the method proposed in [1] and [2].  

To run the programm, excute the run.m file. In run.m file You can set a desired direction for walking, and the program will generate appropriate footsteps, ZMP trajectories and CoM trajectory.

This package contains a foot print generator, ZMP generator and a CoM pattern generator. For more detail about the method please refer to [1] and [2].
